I am a Research Coordinator for the Poldrack Lab in the Psychology Department at Stanford University.

I am currently working under Patrick Bissett and Russel Poldrack, trying to undertand the cognitive structure of response inhibition wihtin the brain. I focus on the using fmri methods to study cognitive control, more specifically response inhibition and self regulation.
